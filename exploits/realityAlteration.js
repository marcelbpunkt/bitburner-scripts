	1. Open the debug window (Debug -> Activate)
	2. Click on the "Sources" tab at the top.
	3. In the left window (where all the dirs and files are),
	go to webpack:// -> . -> src -> NetscriptFunctions -> Extra.ts
	and click it to open in the middle window
	4. Set a breakpoint at L53 (the line may vary depending on
	which version of the game you run), inside the function
	"alterReality" one line below "let x = false;"
	5. Execute this script. It should halt at the breakpoint
	you set in the previous step.
	6. change the value of x to true.
	7. Continue the script execution.
	8. Go wheeeee \o/ You got the achievement.
	9. Remove the breakpoint unless you want the function to
	halt every time you execute it ;) */
